# The <strong>Sapphire Veil</strong> of NGC 281

I thought I knew what beauty was until I drifted into the sapphire embrace of NGC 281, the so-called "Pacman Nebula." But there is nothing playful about this place—only quiet majesty, the kind that makes you feel both infinite and unbearably small.
<br><br>
The nebula’s gas clouds swirled like ocean tides, a deep blue veil cut through by rivers of golden plasma. My ship’s sensors couldn’t keep up with the shifting radiation patterns, but I just sat in the cockpit, staring. It reminded me of those childhood nights back on Earth, lying in the grass, staring at the sky, wondering what was out there. I always knew I would go. I just didn’t know how much I’d leave behind.
There was a time when I thought solitude would be empowering. That I’d feel free, unshackled from the noise of Earth. And yet, watching the nebula glow with colors my eyes could barely process, I found myself reaching—instinctively—for someone to share it with. But there was no one. Just the hum of the ship and the weight of silence.
<br><br>
I stayed longer than I should have, burning fuel as I drifted, unable to pull myself away from the sight. Eventually, duty called, and I set my course for the next waypoint. As the nebula faded into the distance, I wondered how many more wonders I would see before I no longer felt the need to turn to my side, expecting someone to be there.
