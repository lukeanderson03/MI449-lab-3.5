# The <strong>Ghost Moons</strong> of Gliese 581d

The atmosphere of Gliese 581d is thick, smothering, but it paints the sky in a way that makes the whole world look like the inside of an opal—shimmering, unpredictable, alive. Two ghostly moons hover above, their orbits so tight they appear to be locked in an eternal dance.
<br></br>
I walked across the planet’s surface today. My boots left deep impressions in the red dust, and I had the strange sensation of being the first and last to ever disturb it. There was something sacred about that.
<br></br>
I thought about home again—about the people who told me I was making a mistake, about the things I promised to return to. I knew I wouldn’t. Not because I didn’t want to, but because I had always belonged out here, in the quiet spaces between stars. Still, on nights like this, with only the moons watching over me, I wondered if anyone back on Earth looked up at the sky and thought of me.
<br></br>
The ship’s AI reminds me I need to leave soon. The gravitational shifts here are unpredictable, and if I linger too long, I might not make it out.
<br></br>
I take one last look at the ghost moons. I like to think they were once part of something greater, a planet that shattered long ago but still clings to the dance it started. Maybe that’s all we can do—keep moving, keep orbiting, even when everything we knew is long gone.
