## About Me

<div class="about-info">
My name is Captain Elias Varen, and I am an interstellar explorer charting the wonders of the Milky Way. Alone aboard my ship, the Solitude, I travel from nebulae to exoplanets, documenting the breathtaking and the bizarre. Every star I pass, every world I touch, is another piece of a puzzle I may never complete—but that won’t stop me from trying.<br><br>
I knew what I was signing up for when I left Earth. I knew that the cost of discovery was solitude, that I would trade the familiar for the infinite. I don’t regret it. But sometimes, amid the silence of deep space, I wonder about the echoes of the life I left behind.<br><br>
This log is my attempt to capture the beauty and strangeness of the galaxy—the places I go, the sights I see, and the thoughts that linger in the quiet moments between stars. If you’ve ever looked up at the night sky and felt the pull of the unknown, then maybe, in some way, you and I are not so different.<br><br>
